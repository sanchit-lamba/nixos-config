  # This is a home-manager module for user-specific winapps configuration
  # The actual winapps functionality is configured at the system level
  # in modules/programs/virtualization/winapps.nix
  
  # Add any user-specific winapps configuration here if needed
  # For now, this module is minimal as winapps is primarily system-level
